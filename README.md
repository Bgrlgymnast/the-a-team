## Overview
In our final project for SMU Data Bootcamps our team has decided to use Data Model Implementation and Optimization to try and predict President.
- Would the US be prosperous?
- Can the model output predict classification accuracy equal to or higher than 75% or with an 0.80 R-squarde?

### **Stage 1** 
**Ingest and clean**
- Clean, normalize, and standardize data set
- Upload data to a database (postgress)

### **Stage 2**
**Develop and optimize model**
- Initializes Python script, trains, and evaluates a model
    - Model output of predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared (Single Model)
    - Model output of predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared (Multi-ouput Model)
- Optimize model 
    - show iterative changes 
    - show change results in model performance
    - documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script 
- Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script

### **Stage 3**
**Visualize** 
- Create front end visuals with Streamlit

### **DELIVERABLE: President**

- Input birth day,  birth month and party: 
    - Drop Down, reduces the chance for error and none guesses

### **Return predictions about the state of the country based on the President:**
- What president you are most like?
- What VP you would get along with best?
- Will the economy be on and upswing or downswing?
- What was the GDP growth?
- Population growth increase (would you be a babymaker)
